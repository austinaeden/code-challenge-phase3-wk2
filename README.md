Phase-03-code-challenge-wk-2

## Description
This is my week 2 phase 3 code challenge showing how I did it.

For this assignment, we'll be working with a Yelp-style domain.

We have three models:
- `Restaurant`
- `Customer`
- `Review`

For our purposes, a `Restaurant` has many `Reviews`, a `Customer` has many `Review`s, and 
a `Review` belongs to a `Customer` and to a `Restaurant`.

## Topics
- Classes and Instances
- Class and Instance Methods
- Variable Scope
- Object Relationships
- lists and list Methods

## Technologies Used
This challenge was mainly based on
- Python

## Instructions
To get started, use this PipfileLinks to an external site. to install all dependencies required for this project.
Build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. The methods are listed in a suggested order, but you can feel free to tackle the ones you think are easiest. Be careful: some of the later methods rely on earlier ones.
Note!  - You'll need to create your own test sample instances so that you can try/test out your code. Make sure your relationships and methods work in the console before submitting.
Writing error-free code is more important than completing all of the deliverables listed - prioritize writing methods that work over writing more methods that don't work. You should test your code in the console as you write.
Similarly, messy code that works is better than clean code that doesn't. First, prioritize getting things working. Then, if there is time at the end, refactor your code to adhere to best practices. When you encounter duplicated logic, extract it into a shared helper method.
Before you submit! - Save and run your code to verify that it works as you expect. If you have any methods that are not working yet, feel free to leave comments describing your progress.

## Installation
To install this project, you need to have vs-code, git installed in your machine.

Then simply clone the reposetory at the terminal n then by using the command 'git clone https://github.com/austinaeden/code-challenge-phase3-wk2.git 

Then navigate to the project directory by using the command "cd code-challenge-phase3-wk2".

Then view the files to see the solutions

That's it! The project should now be up and running on your local machine. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the project's documentation or create an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

## Usage 
Copy the codes to a pythone shell then run them to see the value.

If you encounter any issues while using the project, refer to the project's documentation or creat an issue on the projects GitHub repository.

That's it! The project should be easy to use, with clear instructions provided on each page. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to the project's maintainers.
